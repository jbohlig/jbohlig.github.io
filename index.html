        <p>
            My name is John Bohlig. I live in Gilbert, Arizona with my wife, Cassie, my two children, Ashley and Jacob and our dog, Riley.
            We recently relocated to Arizona from the suburbs of Chicago. I currently work for Origami Risk, where I serve as
            a Senior Client Executive implementing our risk management, claims and policy administration system for clients.

        <p>
            I attended the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, where I earned a bachelor's degree in Psychology.
            After college I started work for an insurance company as a claims adjuster. Shortly after, I moved into IT
            as a business analyst helping to design new systems to support claims and underwriting. I have been in technology
            ever since and have held a variety of roles.  Some of the companies I have worked for include Zurich North America, Allianz
            Global Corporate & Specialty and Aon eSolutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have always had an interest in technology since my parents bought me my very first computer. My current role 
            requires a fair amount of technical skill using javascript and sql. I decided to take a full stack development course
            primarily to enhance my understanding of how web based applications are constructed. I hope that it will help
            me grow in my current career, and perhaps open new opportunities in the future.
