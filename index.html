                My name is John Bohlig. I live in Gilbert, Arizona with my wife, Cassie, my two children, Ashley and
                Jacob and our dog, Riley. We recently relocated to Arizona from the suburbs of Chicago. I currently work for Origami Risk, where I
                serve as a Senior Client Executive implementing our risk management, claims and policy administration system for clients.
            </p>

            <p id="p2">
                I attended the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, where I earned a bachelor's degree in
                Psychology. After college I started work for an insurance company as a claims adjuster. Shortly after, I moved into
                IT as a business analyst helping to design new systems to support claims and underwriting. I have been in
                technology ever since and have held a variety of roles. Some of the companies I have worked for include Zurich
                North America, Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty and Aon eSolutions.
            </p>

            <p id="p3">
                I have always had an interest in technology since my parents bought me my very first computer. My
                current role requires a fair amount of technical skill using javascript and sql. I decided to take a full stack
                development course primarily to enhance my understanding of how web based applications are constructed. I hope that it will
                help me grow in my current career, and perhaps open new opportunities in the future.
